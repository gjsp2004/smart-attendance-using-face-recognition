This project utilizes OpenCV in Python to implement facial recognition technology. It captures live video feed from a camera, detects faces, and matches them against a pre-trained dataset. Upon successful recognition, it logs the attendance of recognized individuals in a database. The system provides real-time feedback, displaying recognized faces and updating attendance records dynamically. It offers a streamlined and efficient method for automating attendance tracking in various settings.
